# Electronic-Department-Case-Study
Emergency departments play an important role in providing immediate and life saving care under severe resource limitations. In this case study we examine the present condition of the emergency department of a medium-sized hospital that has almost 55000 patients in a year. The ED faces struggle in resource overuse and efficiency in workflows like registration, triage, and patient routing. The goal of this project is to create a streamlined system that improves patient flow, staff satisfaction, and resource utilisation, ultimately providing high-quality, efficient treatment, by utilising key performance indicators (KPIs) and BPMN and UML to analyse present processes.
